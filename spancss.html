        <h1>Front End Designing</h1>
        <p><span>Web development</span> is a blanket term used to describe the work involved in building and developing websites. This broad description covers everything from a single, <span>static web page</span> to <span>complex applications</span> for e-commerce and social networking.

 

            Web developer skills are often applied to the non-design aspects of building websites â€“ writing <span>markup and coding</span>. Web developers may also use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier for other developers or end-users who may lack technical skills. Web designers and user interface designers are more likely to work on the user experience side of this process, making decisions about page styles, colors, images, type font selection and other details.
