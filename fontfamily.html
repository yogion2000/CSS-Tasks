    <h3>Supervised Machine Learning:</h3>
    <p>In supervised ML, the model is trained with labeled input data that correlates to a specified output. For example, a dataset of animal photos (input data) can be labeled as “cats” or “not cats” (output data). The model is continuously refined to provide more accurate output as additional training data becomes available. After the model has learned from the patterns in the training data, it can then analyze additional data to produce the desired output. Results of supervised ML models are typically reviewed by humans for accuracy and fed back into the model for further refinement. Supervised ML is successful when the model can consistently produce accurate predictions when provided with new datasets. For example, the ML model learns to recognize if a new picture is a cat or not.</p>
    <h3>Unsupervised Machine Learning:</h3>
    <p> In unsupervised ML, the input data is not labeled nor is the output specified. Instead, the models are fed large amounts of raw data and the algorithms are designed to identify any underlying meaningful patterns. The algorithms may cluster similar data but do so without any preconceived notion of the output. For example, a time series of trade events can be inputted into an unsupervised model, with the model identifying groups of similar trades as well as outliers. Results of unsupervised machine learning models are then interpreted by humans to determine if they are meaningful and relevant.</p>
    <h3>Reinforcement Learning:</h3>
    <p>In reinforcement learning, the model learns dynamically to achieve the desired output through trial and error. If the model algorithm performs correctly and achieves the intended output, it is rewarded. Conversely, if it does not produce the desired output, it is penalized. Accordingly, the model learns over time to perform in a way that maximizes the net reward. For example, in the securities industry, reinforcement learning models are being explored for options pricing and hedging.</p>
